# 🚀 1000 Days of Hardware: The Journey to Mastery

> **"You don't need to be a genius every day, you just need to show up."**

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am **Chavan Kumar JV**, a 2nd-year Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) student at SJB Institute of Technology (Class of 2028). 

My goal is simple but ambitious: **Build a "Green Wall" of consistency** on GitHub by solving hardware problems, designing circuits, and writing Verilog code every single day until I graduate.
